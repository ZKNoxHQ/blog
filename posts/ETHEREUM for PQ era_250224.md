## Introduction

As the era of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography approaches, ensuring that blockchain systems like Ethereum can efficiently verify PQ signatures is crucial. One of the core operations for many PQ schemes is the **Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)**, which plays a fundamental role in accelerating cryptographic computations. In any cryptographic library, **fast multiplier** is the atomic critical operation. This is the lowest level function, typically optimized using assembly or crypto-accelerator.
While traditional crypt-accelerators leverage fast multiplication over large fields (256 to 512 bits), using Montgomery multiplier as their core operator, lattices operate on polynomial over smaller fields, requiring an hardware architecture update.

At ZKNOX, we have been exploring ways to make [PQ signature verification](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-road-to-post-quantum-ethereum-transaction-is-paved-with-account-abstraction-aa/21783) on Ethereum more gas-efficient. Our latest work focuses on implementing NTT in **Yul**, benchmarking its performance, and proposing a long-term solution to Ethereumâ€™s PQ challenges.

## Optimizing NTT in Yul for Gas-Efficient PQ Verification

NTT is an essential component in many lattice-based PQ signature schemes, including **FALCON** and **DILITHIUM**, two leading candidates from the NIST PQC competition. To enable efficient verification of these schemes on Ethereum, we implemented NTT in **Yul**, Ethereumâ€™s low-level intermediate language, which offers finer control over gas optimizations.

Our benchmarks showed significant improvements:
- A full **FALCON** signature verification now consumes just **3.6M gas**â€”a substantial reduction compared to previous implementations.
- Similar performance gains were observed for DILITHIUM and other PQ schemes relying on NTT.

While this optimization enables rapid experimentation and improves efficiency, the cost is still **too high for Ethereum PQ scaling** in the long term.

## The Need for NTT as an Ethereum Precompile

Despite the gas savings from our Yul implementation, the cost of verifying PQ signatures remains a major bottleneck for practical adoption. This is why we advocate for **including NTT as an Ethereum precompile**. This proposition is now submitted in predraft mode as [EIP-7885](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9374).

### Why a Precompile?
A precompile is a smart contract-like function implemented at the protocol level, offering much **lower gas costs** than executing the same logic in Solidity or Yul. Adding NTT as a precompile would:
- **Drastically reduce gas costs** for PQ signature verification.
- **Enable Ethereum to support multiple PQ candidates** instead of being limited to a single scheme.
- **Enhance Ethereumâ€™s crypto-agility**, ensuring smooth transitions as new PQ standards evolve.

## Towards a Crypto-Agile Ethereum

Rather than committing Ethereum to a single PQ scheme, integrating an NTT precompile lays the foundation for broader PQ adoption. This approach ensures Ethereum remains flexible and secure as cryptographic advancements continue.

By making NTT efficient and widely accessible, we move closer to a **scalable, quantum-resistant Ethereum**â€”one that is prepared for the post-quantum future without sacrificing usability.


## Reduce Starks settlement

Starks is a ZK technology used to scale ETHEREUM by ZKEVM layer 2 like Starknet, Succint.
NTT is also required during Starks settlement. This [post](https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/faster.html) describes its role in the conception of a fast stark verifier. In addition to PQ cryptography, EIP-7885 also reduces cost for settlement.

## Conclusion

Post-quantum security is not just a distant concernâ€”itâ€™s an imminent challenge that must be addressed today. Our work optimizing NTT in Yul demonstrates the potential for gas-efficient PQ verification, but a long-term solution requires **Ethereum protocol changes**.

We believe an **NTT precompile** is the next logical step towards **PQ crypto-agility** and **ZK transition**. We invite the Ethereum community, researchers, and developers to join the [discussion](https://ethresear.ch/t/ntt-as-postquantum-and-starks-settlements-helper-precompile/21775) and push forward this crucial upgrade.
