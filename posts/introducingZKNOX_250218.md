## Advancing Hardware Security & Cryptography.

Today, we‚Äôre excited to introduce ZKNOX, a new venture founded by three experts in hardware security and cryptography (ECC, ZK, MPC). With deep expertise in securing critical systems, our mission is to advance secure hardware, cryptographic protocols, and blockchain-integrated security solutions‚Äîwith a strong alignment to Ethereum, defensive and decentralized technologies.

We‚Äôre bringing deep expertise and innovation to every challenge on the whole security chain, from user end (be it secure enclaves, hardware wallets), back end (TEE, HSMs) or on-chain (smart contracts).

Stay tuned for updates as we share insights, breakthroughs, and product developments. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more, reach out to us‚Äîwe‚Äôre just getting started.


## The team


- Bacca Nicolas - Co-founder and ex-CTO of the unicorn Ledger, with 25+ years of experience in building and breaking secure solutions. Realizations include giving birth to Nano, Ledger best seller.
- Dubois Renaud - Cryptologist with 20 years of experience (Thales Defense, Ledger). Realizations include several [publications](https://dblp.org/pid/26/211.html) and [patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Renaud+Dubois), and delivering the fastest generic [ecc](https://github.com/rdubois-crypto/FreshCryptoLib/blob/master/README.md) implementations, including passkeys integrated in Coinbase Smart Wallet.  
- Masson Simon - Cryptologist with 8 years of experience (Thales, Anoma).
Realizations include several [publications](https://dblp.org/pid/218/7096.html) including Bandersnatch, the fastest embedded curve for ECDSA verification circuit.
