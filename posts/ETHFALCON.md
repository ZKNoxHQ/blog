## Introduction

In a previous note, we discussed the stakes of a post-quantum Ethereum future. This entry highlights ZKNOX's efforts over the past weeks to implement post-quantum signature schemes: FALCON and DILITHIUM.

## Introduction

Among lattice-based signatures, DILITHIUM and FALCON have been selected by NIST as suitable replacements for ECC. While FALCON is the fastest and most compact, its signer complexity is significantly higher. This makes it the preferred choice for on-chain applications, but other factors led us to implement DILITHIUM as well. Notably, DILITHIUM‚Äôs signing algorithm is hardware-friendly and is expected to see secure element implementations in the near future.

## EVM-Friendly Versions

### Profiling

Before full implementation, our team performed an initial assessment of the critical components of both algorithms. A previous post outlined the core operation‚Äîpolynomial multiplication‚Äîand its optimization using the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). ZKNOX successfully reduced a prior Solidity NTT implementation from 20M to 1.5M gas. This optimization made hash-to-field computation the dominant cost.

FALCON requires SHAKE as its hash function, but since SHAKE is not natively supported by the EVM, it must be emulated. Even an optimized Yul implementation of SHAKE‚Äôs core permutation requires around 1M gas, resulting in a total of 10M gas for a full FALCON signature. To address this, we propose security-equivalent but more gas-efficient alternatives: **ETHFALCON** and **ETHDILITHIUM**.

### PRNG

In cryptography, a hash function with a configurable output length is called an XOF (Extendable Output Function). The FALCON specification uses SHAKE as an XOF to generate valid polynomials without bias or collisions. However, SHAKE is not available as an EVM opcode [(see list)](https://www.evm.codes/), making its implementation costly (>4M gas per nonce-to-polynomial conversion). Some proposals replaced SHAKE with Keccak in unconventional ways, deriving output from internal state updates. After discussions with Zhenfei, one of FALCON‚Äôs authors, we decided to replace this approach with a standardized counter-mode generation method.

### Encodings

FALCON‚Äôs raw signature undergoes a **compression function** that reduces its size by 30%. While this is computationally negligible in conventional environments, Solidity‚Äôs costly bitwise operations make compression inefficient on-chain. As a result, **Tetration** opted to use raw signatures as input.

In standard FALCON, signature encoding is unique, enforced by encoding coefficient signs. However, Tetration‚Äôs approach reintroduced **signature malleability**, allowing an attacker to replace a valid signature with another equivalent one‚Äîakin to the ECDSA vulnerability behind the Mt. Gox disaster. To mitigate this, ZKNOX proposed enforcing a fixed sign for the first coefficient, ensuring a unique encoding.

### Recovery Version

A key advantage of FALCON over DILITHIUM is its potential for a **recovery-based verification model**, similar to ECDSA. ZKNOX proposes a recovery version of FALCON that modifies the hash function specification to use the public key‚Äôs NTT representation. This allows verification using only an **NTT forward transform**, eliminating the need for an inverse NTT.

### Toward a PQZK Future

One of Ethereum‚Äôs long-term visions is a **zero-knowledge (ZK) endgame**. ZK circuits working on non-native fields introduce additional proving costs. To address this, we specified **ZK-friendly alternatives** using **M31** and **BabyBear** fields, optimized for **STARK-based proving systems** (e.g., STWO and RISC0). Our goal is to provide a migration path from BabyJubJub, JubJub, and Bandersnatch curves to **FALZKON** and **ZKDILITHIUM** for private payments. The security implications of switching fields will be discussed in a future post.


### Complexities 

| Scheme | Public key size | Signature size |
|-|-|-|
|Falcon|897 B|666 B|
|ETHFalcon|1 024 B|1 064 B|
|Dilithium|1 312 B|2 420 B|
|ETHDilithium|20 512 B|9 248 B|

Note: 

- the inflated ETHFALCON key size comes from a precomputation of Decompress+NTT form of the public key.

- the large key size of ETHDILITHIUM comes from a precomputation of the expand+NTT form of the public key.


## Results

### Benchmarks

The table below summarizes implementation results. While ETHFALCON is mature, WIP algorithms still have significant room for gas cost optimization.

| Function                   | Description               | Gas Cost | Test Status |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------------|

### FALCON: On-Chain Favorite, Signer‚Äôs Nightmare

As expected, **FALCON is the most efficient scheme for verification**. However, implementing its signer in Python provided insight into the challenges hardware implementations will face. Memory consumption is high, and the Gaussian sampler relies on complex floating-point arithmetic.

Discussions with hardware vendors revealed a **strong preference for DILITHIUM** due to these difficulties. However, given Ethereum‚Äôs on-chain constraints, FALCON remains the preferred choice for verification.

### DILITHIUM: Less Efficient, but Valuable Features

DILITHIUM is significantly **less efficient** than FALCON on-chain, with **4√ó higher footprint and gas cost**. However, it offers several advantages:

- **Easier signer implementation:** Secure element vendors are more likely to adopt DILITHIUM, making it a strong candidate for widespread adoption.
- **ZK-friendliness:** A ZK-adapted version of DILITHIUM is more efficient than FALCON‚Äôs ZK counterpart.
- **MPC compatibility:** DILITHIUM is better suited for multi-party computation (MPC) than FALCON, which could simplify adoption in TSS-based wallets like [Unruggable Wallets](https://github.com/rdubois-crypto/UnruggableWallet/tree/main).

| Feature                | FALCON ‚úÖ/‚ùå | DILITHIUM ‚úÖ/‚ùå |
|------------------------|------------|---------------|
| **Gas Efficiency**      | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå            |
| **Bandwidth**          | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå            |
| **Signer Simplicity**  | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ            |
| **ZK Adaptability**    | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ            |
| **MPC Friendliness**   | ‚ùå         | ‚úÖ            |

## Conclusion

Thanks to ZKNOX‚Äôs work, **on-chain post-quantum verification is now feasible** for experimentation. While gas costs are acceptable for L2s, they remain prohibitively high for most L1 use cases‚Äîexcept for verifying high-value transactions. The team continue to work on the ZK versions, and will start embedded implementation.
