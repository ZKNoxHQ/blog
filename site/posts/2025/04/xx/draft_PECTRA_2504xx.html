<title> Bandersnatch, GLV and fakeGLV: Pectra optimal BLS12-381 arithmetic for ZK Dapps </title>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ethereum's update PECTRA comes in the next weeks as an important
update bringing evolutivity and security improvments. Among those, the
integration of <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537">BLS12-381</a> in clients
opens up perspectives for elliptic curves primitives (such as
multi/threshold signatures) with zero-knowledge applications. Among
those are private payments (RAILGUN).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we present how to optimize elliptic curve
operations in the context of PECTRA update, with a focus on <a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1152">BanderSnatch</a>. In
particular, the first known implementation mixing FakeGLV and GLV over
Bandersnatch is provided, leading to the most efficient in-circuit
verification algorithm over BLS12-381 to date. More general tricks for
generic curves (ZKMAIL, ZKWebAuthn) are also discussed.</p>
<h2 id="pectra">Pectra</h2>
<h5 id="from-bn254-to-bls12-381">From BN254 to BLS12-381</h5>
<p>BN254 is an elliptic curve that has been widely used in
zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography due to its efficiency and small
parameter size, but it only provides around 100 bits of security, which
is insufficient for modern cryptographic applications. For stronger
security guarantees, another curve, BLS12-381, has been designed
together with ZK properties. This curve fulfills approximately 128 bits
of security, making it more resistant to potential future attacks. While
it requires slightly larger parameters and computational overhead
compared to BN254, the tradeoff is well worth it for applications that
need stronger cryptographic assurances. Therefore, shifting from BN254
to BLS12-381 is a prudent choice for improving the security of
zero-knowledge systems. Pectra integrates precompiles for the arithmetic
of this curve (see <a
href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537">EIP-2537</a>). In a
recent post Distributed Labs provides some insight on the prover
complexity which, are not very far from its less secure version. Those
complexity are however in a range where linear improvments are felt by
the user (a few seconds).</p>
<h5 id="cryptographic-primitive-above-bls12-381">Cryptographic primitive
<em>above</em> BLS12-381</h5>
<p>In the context of zero-knowledge proofs, it is sometimes required to
compute elliptic curve arithmetic that will be, later on, verified
in-circuit using BLS12-381. It is common to choose an elliptic curve
designed to make ZK proofs efficient, called <em>embedded curves</em>.
The curve is selected so that the verification algorithm involves native
arithmetic for the ZK proof circuit. For BLS12-381, the ZK circuit is
defined modulo a prime <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>
(which is BLS12-381 <em>scalar field order</em>). In this context, an
embedded curve is defined over <span
class="math inline">ùîΩ<sub><em>r</em></sub></span>. While in-circuit
verification is made efficient by this choice of base field, signature
generation must also be fast in specific use-cases. Two curves have been
designed for this purpose: <a
href="https://bitzecbzc.github.io/technology/jubjub/index.html">Jubjub</a>
and <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-bandersnatch-a-fast-elliptic-curve-built-over-the-bls12-381-scalar-field">Bandersnatch</a>.
The latter has been designed so that scalar multiplications are more
efficient. In the next section, we dig into the details of elliptic
curve scalar multiplications in order to understand the benefits of
Bandersnatch.</p>
<h2 id="elliptic-curve-arithmetic">Elliptic curve arithmetic</h2>
<p>Elliptic curves are used in cryptography to construct secure key
exchange protocols and digital signatures, leveraging their algebraic
structure to provide strong security with relatively small key
sizes.</p>
<h5 id="scalar-multiplication-sm">Scalar multiplication (SM)</h5>
<p>The critical algorithm used in cryptography based on elliptic curves
(ECC) is the <em>scalar multiplication</em>. Given a scalar <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> (usually of 256 bits), and a point
<span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> of the curve, the point
<span class="math inline">[<em>k</em>]<em>P</em></span> is computed
using the group law defined on the curve. This computation depends on
the model used for the curve, but the cost is about <span
class="math inline">2log<sub>2</sub>(<em>k</em>)</span> point additions.
We do not go into the details of this cost in order to keep things as
simple as possible.</p>
<h5 id="multi-scalar-multiplication-msm">Multi-scalar multiplication
(MSM)</h5>
<p>In signature verification, it is common to compute multi-scalar
multiplications (MSM) <span
class="math inline">[<em>k</em>]<em>P</em>‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ[‚Ñì]<em>Q</em></span> for
scalars <span class="math inline"><em>k</em>,‚ÄÜ‚Ñì‚ÄÑ&lt;‚ÄÑ<em>r</em></span>.
After precomputing <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ<em>Q</em></span>, it is possible to
compute <span
class="math inline">[<em>k</em>]<em>P</em>‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ[‚Ñì]<em>Q</em></span> in
only <span class="math inline">2log<sub>2</sub>(<em>r</em>)</span> point
additions, by reading simultaneously the bits of <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> and <span
class="math inline">‚Ñì</span>. More generally, a <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-MSM <span
class="math inline">$\sum_{i=1}^n [k_i]P_i$</span> can be computed in
<span class="math inline">2<sup><em>n</em></sup>‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ<em>n</em>‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ1</span>
precomputation additions, and <span
class="math inline">2log<sub>2</sub>(<em>r</em>)</span> additions for
the simultaneous computation. From now, we denote <span
class="math inline">MSM(<em>n</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>N</em>)</span> the cost in
elliptic curve additions of a multi-scalar multiplication of <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> points with scalar of <span
class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> bits: <span
class="math inline">MSM(<em>n</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>N</em>)‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ2<sup><em>n</em></sup>‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ<em>n</em>‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ1‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ2<em>N</em></span>.
Note that in practice, additional operations are required and not taken
into account in this blog post.</p>
<h5 id="fixed-point-sm">Fixed point SM</h5>
<p>When <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> is fixed, we can use
the above technique in order to speed-up a SM: precomputing <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ[2<sup><em>i</em><em>N</em>/<em>n</em></sup>]<em>P</em></span>
and <span class="math inline">$k = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i 2^{iN/n}$</span>, we
can decompose <span class="math inline">$[k]P = \sum_{i=1}^n
[k_i]P_i$</span>. This technique works in practice, but the
precomputation part becomes expensive as long as <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> grows, as illustrated in the
following table (where the costs are estimated in point additions, with
the simplified formula above):</p>

<p>In the case of signature verification for an account, where the
public key is the fixed point, this speed up can be used. It is
implemented in efficient libraries, such as BOLOS, FCL and OpenZeppelin
P256 libraries (leading to their lesser gas cost compared to Daimo), and
SCL generic one. This algorithm is also the scope of <a
href="https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7696.md">RIP7696</a>.
However in the case of ZK, where public key is kept as a secret input,
it is not possible to use this algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>BanderSnatch solves this using a combination of GLV and
fakeGLV.</strong></p>
<h2 id="bandersnatch">Bandersnatch</h2>
<p>Bandersnatch is an embedded curve, such as BabyJujub, which presents
a GLV endomorphism. Having a GLV endomorphism allows faster SM.</p>
<h5 id="glv-optimization"><a
href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390189.pdf">GLV</a>
optimization</h5>
<p>Small discriminant curves have a specfic structure that speeds up the
scalar multiplication: there exists an (efficiently computable but non
trivial) endomorphism <span class="math inline"><em>œï</em></span> that
has an eigenvalue <span class="math inline"><em>Œª</em></span> on the
points of order <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>. It results
that we can decompose <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>k</em><sub>1</sub>‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ<em>Œª</em><em>k</em><sub>2</sub>‚ÄÄmod‚ÄÜ¬†<em>r</em></span>
with <span
class="math inline">log<sub>2</sub>(<em>k</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ128</span>,
and the cost of a scalar multiplication is thus obtain <span
class="math inline">MSM(2,‚ÄÜ128)</span>.</p>
<h5 id="fake-glv-a-hinted-verification-for-zk-uses.">Fake-GLV: a hinted
verification for ZK uses.</h5>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are widespread cryptographic tools in
blockchain, and one expensive computation is the scalar multiplication.
In this context, we want to prove that <span
class="math inline">[<em>k</em>]<em>P</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>Q</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> is a hinted point (provided as
additional helper input).FakeGLV, was recently introduced by <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/fake-glv-you-dont-need-an-efficient-endomorphism-to-implement-glv-like-scalar-multiplication-in-snark-circuits/20394">[YEH]</a>
using a fractional decomposition of <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>u</em>/<em>v</em>‚ÄÄmod‚ÄÜ¬†<em>r</em></span>.
It is possible to find <span
class="math inline"><em>u</em>,‚ÄÜ<em>v</em></span> of size almost <span
class="math inline">128</span> bits and get the same speed-up as for
GLV: <span
class="math inline">[<em>k</em>]<em>P</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>Q</em>‚ÄÑ‚áî‚ÄÑ[<em>u</em>]<em>P</em>‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ[<em>v</em>]<em>Q</em>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0</span>.
In this context, we can verifiy the scalar multiplication in-circuit in
<span class="math inline">MSM(2,‚ÄÜ128<sup>+</sup>)</span>. This technique
can be combined with GLV (as mentioned by Liam Eagen <a
href="https://ethresear.ch/t/fake-glv-you-dont-need-an-efficient-endomorphism-to-implement-glv-like-scalar-multiplication-in-snark-circuits/20394/2">here</a>)
in order to compute the verification in <span
class="math inline">MSM(4,‚ÄÜ64<sup>+</sup>)</span>. The bound on the
obtained scalars can be estimated using lattice reduction.</p>
<h5 id="in-circuit-msm">In-circuit MSM</h5>
<p>If ZK is used for <strong>validity</strong> and not privacy, then it
is possible to use MSM. When applying the previous technique for
multi-scalar multiplications, it is possible to reduce the cost of a
<span class="math inline">2</span>-MSM (and more generally a <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-MSM). However, the gain is not
significant in R1CS due to lookups cost for native curves. It has a
potential outcome for non native, such as P256 as used by ZKMAIL,
ZKWebAuthn.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<h5 id="private-walletsprivacy-pools">Private Wallets/Privacy Pools</h5>
<p>All cryptographic primitives that can be converted into
zero-knowledge schemes should be implemented using Bandersnatch. <a
href="https://www.railgun.org/">Railgun</a> enables privacy in Ethereum
using a ZK construction with BabyJubjub and the pairing-based curve
BN254. This shall be updated to work with Bandernsatch and BLS12-381 in
order to reach a state of the art security level as well, without loss
of efficiency.</p>
<h5 id="zkwebauthn-zkmail">ZKWebAuthn, ZKMail</h5>
<p>ZKMail and ZKWebAuthn are systems that allow users to prove ownership
of an email address (resp. Passkey credential) without revealing the
actual email content, metadata, or even the email address itself (resp.
credentials). During authentication, the server sends a challenge,
signed by the user, but rather than the signature, a ZK-proof of the
signature is send instead and verified onchain.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This note described several optimizations to improve both security
and UX (reducing the prover computations, i.e the latency of the
phone/labtop) for the most popular ZK applications. GLV is linked to
Bandersnatch, but fakeGLV+2MSM principle can be applied (with lesser
gain) to generic curves. The provided python code is a first step before
developing the circuits for an integration into proving backends. When
moving to BLS12, Bandersnatch outperform Jujub and is the optimal
choice.</p>
